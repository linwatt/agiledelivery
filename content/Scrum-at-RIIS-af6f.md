Scrum is an iterative, incremental agile methodology for project delivery. This framework leverages cross-functional, self-organizing teams that work to deliver production ready features in time boxed iterations called Sprints.

Scrum provides:
- A light weight team-based development framework rooted in incremental delivery
- A simple approach toward addressing complex work
- A set of practices to keep everything visible
- A mechanism to maximize value for the customer

The Scrum approach has a set of Roles, Artifacts and Ceremonies (highly-structured meetings) that work most efficiently when used together.
