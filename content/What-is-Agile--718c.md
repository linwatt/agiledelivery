Agile software development is a group of software development methodologies based on iterative and incremental development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing, cross-functional teams. Planning leverages frequent inspection to drive near-term objectives and predict outcomes. Change is welcome at all stages and managed to ensure maximum return for the business. Delivery occurs early and often in order to provide increased customer value.
