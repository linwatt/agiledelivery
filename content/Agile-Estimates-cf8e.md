Each User Story must be estimated before it can be considered in a work plan. The estimate is an attribute of the User Story. The story point estimate represents the team's relative estimate as it relates to effort, unknown, and complexity.

Agile Sizesâ€¦
- Give a sense as to the cost to execute a Story Card
- Are reference points for prioritization decisions
- Serve as a key consideration in Agile Planning efforts
- Can be done using:
  - Story Points
  - Days
  - Ideal Days
  - Projected hours of work effort
  - T-Shirt Sizes

The recommended sizing approach at RIIS is to use T-Shirt sizes (XS, S, M, L, XL, XXXXL), with corresponding story points. The values are below:
**XS** - 1 story point 
**S** - 2 story points 
**M** - 4 story points 
**L** - 8 story points 
**XL** - 16 story points 
**XXXXL** - 128 story points (also called "epic" which needs to be broken down into smaller stories)
