The standard artifact for capturing requirements in agile delivery is the **User Story**. It serves as the placeholder of conversation for a defined feature or deliverable. User stories should be written to represent a unit of work using the **INVEST** criteria.

**I - Independent**
The user story should be self-contained and written to have a minimum of dependencies

**N - Negotiable**	
User stories are written as conversation placeholders and can be updated or negotiated up until they are placed in a sprint

**V - Valuable**	
A user story must deliver value to the end user or customer

**E - Estimatable**	
You must always be able to estimate the size of a user story.

**S	- Small**	
User stories should be sized appropriately with near term stories broken up small enough to be completed in a sprint

**T -	Testable**	
User stories should be able to be tested as either “Pass” or “Fail” for acceptance
