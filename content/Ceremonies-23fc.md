Scrum projects start with a planning phase to prepare for the process of iterating. A Sprint cadence then begins and continues for the life of the project with structured Ceremonies.

<h2>Scrum Planning (Sprint 0)</h2>
When a project begins, the team starts with Scrum Planning, a phase before Sprinting starts where the team defines the work that needs to be done and sets the initial release schedule.

Scrum Planningâ€¦
- Is conducted with whole team, including the Product Owner
- Engages all necessary members of the Extended Team to define their responsibilities and level of involvement

Below is a list of activities that are typically included in Scrum Planning (Sprint 0):
  - Creation of the Product Backlog and Release Plan (aka Roadmap)
  - Story mapping sessions and user story creation
  - Initial user story prioritization and sizing
  - Elaboration of top priority features to be worked on in initial Sprints
  - Identification and engagement of all necessary members (core and extended teams) and definition of their roles and responsibilities
  - Training of project resources (if necessary)
  - Set up sprint cadence and ceremonies
  - Project Overview Document/Kickoff/Big Picture Diagram
  - Set up project in the appropriate tools (OpenAir, BaseCamp, JIRA, etc.)
  - Set up project wall
  - Define the definitions of Ready and Done with the team
  - Set up development and testing tools
  - Stand up of demonstration environment; establish the plan for other environments
