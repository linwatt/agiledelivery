<h2>Daily Scrum (Stand up)</h2>
**Goal:** To review the team’s progress as well as identify any impediments or roadblocks
**When:** Daily throughout the sprint (first thing in the morning)
**Duration:** Time boxed to 15 minutes
**Participants:** Scrum Master, Product Owner, and the Team

This meeting occurs daily within a sprint. The goal is to review the team’s progress as well as identify any impediments or opportunities to be more efficient. Each participant takes a turn answering questions related to their status. The three questions are:

1) What have you worked on since the last stand up?
2) What do you plan on working on until the next stand up?
3) What impedes you from performing your work as effectively as possible?

The stand-up should occur in a consistent place each day and attendance is mandatory. When team members are remote, tools such as Skype can be used to facilitate the meeting and conversation. If a participant is unable to attend, another team member can also speak on their behalf. It is important to be brief and focus on answering the three questions and moving on. The Scrum Master is responsible for facilitating the meeting and keeping it focused. If there is a topic that members wish to have further conversation about, a request can be made to have further conversation or set up a meeting after the stand-up.

<h2>Sprint Review</h2>
**Goal:** To review the features completed during the sprint.
**When:** End of the sprint (Before the Retrospective).
**Duration:** One hour per sprint
**Participants:** Scrum Master, Product Owner, Stakeholders, the Team.

This meeting occurs at the end of each sprint. The objective is to demonstrate all the functionality completed within the sprint. Functionality that is not completed based on the “done” and acceptance criteria will not be shown and will need to be placed on the backlog to be sized and planned. For each item completed, the Analyst will read the user story as well as the “done” criteria and demonstrate it. The features should be demonstrated in the environment closest to production (UAT). 
The decision will then be made by the Product Owner whether the user story can be considered “done” and is accepted. If so, the feature is then eligible for release and is production ready. Any changes and/or features requested as a result of this review meeting should be captured as new user stories, sized, and prioritized by the Product Owner.

<h2>Sprint Retrospective</h2>
**Goal:** To review what worked well in the sprint and could be improved with the process
**When:** End of the sprint
**Duration:** One hour per sprint
**Participants:** Scrum Master, the Team, and Product Owner

This is the last meeting within a sprint. The objective is to review what went well and opportunities for improvement for the upcoming sprints. The team should begin the meeting by listing what stories were planned versus completed within the sprint for context. The two questions that are answered are:

1) What went well during the last sprint?
2) What could be improved in the next sprint?

The Scrum Master is there strictly to facilitate and document the answers provided by the team; not to provide the answers. After brainstorming the items that went well and what could use improvement, the team should prioritize the list in the order they’d like to discuss the opportunities for improvement. Actionable items should be added to the backlog for visibility and prioritization.As a facilitator, the Scrum Master should facilitate the group to answer the below questions:
- Objective - What happened?
- Reflective - How do we feel about it?
- Interpretive - What does it mean?
- Decision - What are we going to do about it?
  - This comes last!!

<h2>Backlog Grooming</h2>
As a project progresses, new details will require the addition, deletion or change to items on the Product Backlog. Some items may need elaboration. All items need to be estimated.

Backlog Grooming…
- Is when the Team meets with the Product Owner to refine the Product Backlog
- Adds, deletes or updates Story Cards on the Product Backlog
- Elaborates complex or large Story Cards
- Accumulates supporting detail for Story Cards
- Adjusts the Prioritization of Product Backlog items

This meeting can be ad hoc or regularly scheduled. This meeting can also be called User Story Workshops.
