<h2>Backlog Sizing</h2>
**Goal:** To size the Product Backlog features in priority order to provide a guide for planning
**When:** Beginning of each sprint
**Duration:** One hour per sprint
**Participants:** Scrum Master, the Team

This is the first meeting to occur within a sprint. The objective is to place a relative size on items represented on the Backlog (user stories). The team will review the items and place a rough order of magnitude on the items to assist the Product Owner in his/her prioritization. The recommended unit for sizing is t-shirt sizes (which translate to story points). The story point estimates represent effort, doubt, and complexity. At RIIS, we use T-Shirt sizes which convert to story points as a best practice to facilitate a quick estimate and discussion. Their values are below:

XS=1, S=2, M=4, L=8, XL=16, XXXXL=128

If a story is either too large or has too much unknown to size, it is given an “epic” value which is represented at XXXXL. This means that it requires further analysis and break down before the team can size it. The Analyst or Scrum Master facilitates the review of each story in priority order. The story is read, the team has time to discuss (2-3 minutes), and then the team presents the appropriate t-shirt size to represent the entire team effort.

Should the team not have consensus, they are provided additional time to discuss (2-3 minutes) and then asked to re-vote. If the team does not have consensus after 3 votes, the larger size can be used.

<h2>Sprint Planning</h2>
**Goal:** To select and agree upon acceptance criteria for the features that will be worked on during the sprint
**When:** Beginning of each sprint
**Duration:** One hour per sprint
**Participants:** 
Part i: Scrum Master, Product Owner, and the Team. 
Part ii: Scrum Master, Team

The Planning meeting occurs at the beginning of each sprint after sizing. The objective is to select the functionality from the Product Backlog that will be worked on in the sprint. It is time boxed and has two parts. The first consists of the Product Owner and Analyst presenting the team with the priority items for the upcoming sprint. The team will use the velocity as well as the knowledge of the features to determine which stories can be committed to for that sprint. For those items selected, acceptance and “done” criteria should be discussed and documented on the user story for complete understanding.

The second part of the meeting is for the team to then determine how the commitment will be met and what activities and/or tasks need to be completed to meet the goal. The Product Owner should be available to the team during this period of time but is not required. The tasks and estimates that may result from this second part of planning become the sprint backlog. The team should focus on moving the stories in the sprint backlog to done in priority order collectively as a team.
