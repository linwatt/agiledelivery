All **Story Cards** for a project are compiled into a **Product Backlog**. A **Release Plan** is built from the Product Backlog. Story Cards are identified for work every Sprint and transferred to the **Sprint Backlog** for management. Sprint progress is tracked using a **Burndown Chart**.

<h2>Product Backlog</h2>
The **Product Backlog** is the primary artifact defining features and other work to be done on a Scrum project.

The Product Backlog…
- Is comprised of prioritized, estimated Story Cards
- Has the appropriate level of detail
- High priority work at the top of the backlog, fully detailed and small in size
- Lower priority work is larger in size, less detailed and further in the backlog
- Changes as new information impacting the product becomes available
- Is the key output from Scrum Planning


<h2>Release Plan</h2>
The **Release Plan** identifies what items on the Product Backlog will be released for use and the forecast for when the release(s) will occur.

The Release Plan…
- Determines what constitutes the most valuable next release
- Defines the minimum feature set for each release -- the smallest amount of must-have features
- Looks long-term to identify what features will be delivered when and at what cost
- Can be set to Fixed Date or Fixed Scope parameters
- Fixed Cost identifies a date when budget is exhausted using known resource allocations
- Considers a team’s Velocity to project the amount of time needed to complete the remaining work on the Product Backlog
- Updates occur frequently with new information, perhaps every sprint
